# Introducing Deploying ML models with AzureML 

## Objectives

In the following Excercise you will learn:
- Deploy an AzueML model to Azure Container Instance

### Prerequisites

To run through below instructions, you need an Azure subscription, an AzureML workspace and an AzureML compute target (i.e. **cpu-cluster**). See instructions on how to create a workspace [here](../0_setup/setup.md) and create an AzureML compute target [here](../1_concepts/concepts.md). In addition you require the registered model you have trained here [here](../2_training/training.md)

## Exercise: Deploy your model on Azure Container Instance

In the following exercise you will:
- Register the model or load the registered model
- Prepare to deploy. (Specify assets, usage, compute target.)
- Deploy the model to the compute target.
- Test the deployed model, also called a web service.

1. Run the notebook to deploy to ACI [Python SDK - deploy-credit-model.ipynb](https://github.com/Sahiep/aml-lab-notebooks/blob/main/labs/3_deployment/deploy-credit-model.ipynb) 
1. Check for your Endpoint in the Azure ML Workspace
1. Test your new Web Service
